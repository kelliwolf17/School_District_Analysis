# School_District_Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine how the academic dishonesty within Thomas High School's ninth graders testing scores affected the overall analysis previously submitted to the school board.

# Results

## District Summary
For the district summary, the scores and % passing metrics were slightly reduced. One can conclude that some 9th graders from THS inflated their scores, but it did not have a large affect on the whole district.

### With THS 9th Graders:

### Without THS 9th Graders:

## School Sumary
Initially it appeared that replacing values of the test scores for THS 9th graders had a large affect on how THS compared to the old analysis. The percentages dropped 30%+ for each metric. Once the metrics were evaluated a second time to remove the students themselves, not just their grades, we can see that the THS performed similarly overall with or without the 9th graders.

### Re-evaluating THS Percentages

## Top 5 Performers
Removing the 9th graders did not change the Top 5 ranking in the district, nor did it change where THS stood in the rankings.

## Scoring Metrics 
The only change in the scoring metrics between the old analysis and the updated analysis without THS 9th grader's test scores in the data occur in the 'Math Scores' and 'Reading Scores' charts where the 9th Grade is replaced by 'nan'. Otherwise the charts all remain the same. The spending, school size and type did not change just because the scores were removed, so it was not expected that any of these would result in something different.

# Summary
In the school summary, the math and reading scores/passing percentages were changed slightly after the scores for the ninth grade students at Thomas High School were replaced with NaNs. The district summary proved to be lower without their scores, though only minutely. And in viewing the test averages by grade level and school, THS is not able to show the value for 9th grade math and reading.
